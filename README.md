# Pokemon API Mini App

Welcome to the Pokemon API Mini App repository! This simple web application allows you to explore a list of Pokemon and search for specific Pokemon by their name. It's a fun project to get familiar with React and working with external APIs.

## Getting Started

To run this app, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the [Boilerplate React repository](https://github.com/CorentinKSTR/Boilerplate-React.git) to your local machine if you haven't already:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CorentinKSTR/Boilerplate-React.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```shell
   cd Boilerplate-React
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Now that you have the base project set up, let's run the Pokemon API Mini App:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

5. The app will start, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a list of Pokemon along with a search bar.
